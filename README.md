#Tumblr Cleanr

Tumblr Cleanr is a Chrome extension that simplifies Tumblr's interface and removes extraneous paid content. This includes the "Tumblr Radar" sidebar as well as promoted posts.

#FAQ

##Where Can I find the Extension.
[On the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tumblr-cleanr/kmmklbmmlmpoepihmnpohalndeipahac).

##But I like both of those things!

That's fine. I recognize that both of these elements could conceivably yield value to users. I find that the Radar generally superfluous and is being used as a vessel to deliver ads, which I don't want to see. The promoted posts are generally advertisements or solicitations from people or companies I follow, which I likewise don't want to see. If you want to see these things, this extension is not for you.

##How does it work?

The app uses JavaScript to strip the elements from the DOM. CSS is used as a fallback to hide elements.
