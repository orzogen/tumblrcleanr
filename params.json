{"body":"#Tumblr Cleanr\r\n\r\nTumblr Cleanr simplifies Tumblr's interface and removes extraneous paid content. This includes the \"Tumblr Radar\" sidebar as well as promoted posts.\r\n\r\n#FAQ\r\n\r\n##But I like both of those things!\r\n\r\nThat's fine. I recognize that both of these elements could conceivably yield value to users. I find that the Radar generally superfluous and is being used as a vessel to deliver ads, which I don't want to see. The promoted posts are generally advertisements or solicitations from people or companies I follow, which I likewise don't want to see. If you want to see these things, this extension is not for you.\r\n\r\n##How does it work?\r\n\r\nThe app uses JavaScript to strip the elements from the DOM. CSS is used as a fallback to hide elements.\r\n\r\n#Contact\r\n\r\nIf you want to get in touch, shoot me an email at [orzogen@gmail.com](mailto:orzogen@gmail.com).","note":"Don't delete this file!
